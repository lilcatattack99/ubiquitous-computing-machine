		<p>This here was preparatory work for a lino piece. Theme here was animals. For this lino project I 
		went with an owl. To do a lino piece you need a sheet of lino, a cutting knife, paint(any colour) and paper any colour of your choice.
		You trace the image then with the cutting knife, carve out the black or white bits. Depends on your preference.
		After cutting the piece apply paint to the lino the place the coloured sheet on the top. Rub in the sheet 
		then gently peel it of the lino block. And set to dry.</p>

		<p>These paintings were my prepartions for my final illustration. For this our teacher read the briefs from previous years and we would do these practicals in class.
		This improved my art a lot as I was able to experiment a lot with different materials.
		the theme for this painting was a sci-fi fair. The inspiration I took for this was a character from Final Fantasy V11.
		I changed the appearence. This to date is one of my favourite pieces.		</p>
